# Implementation of RED in ns-3 in line with Linux Kernel
## Course Code: CS822
## Assignment: #GP9
### Brief Description:
Modifying RED implementation of ns-3 to make it aligned with the implementation in Linux kernel
### Overview
RED is an AQM algorithm that is implemented in Linux kernel as a qdisc, and in ns-3 as a traffic control model. But there exists some differences in the Linux implementation and the ns-3 implementation. This repository aims to align the ns-3 code for RED with the Linux one.
